General_Bass will be played no matter what emotion the viewer has. (including no emotion)
Anger_Piano and Anger_Guitar should be played depend on the person's anger level. When they are played, the other tracks aside general should be muted.
Happy will be played depend on the person's happy level. Since one probably won't have both anger and happy at the same time, thye exclude each other.

I.E.
 - Somewhat angry - only Anger_Piano
 - Very angry - both Anger_Piano and Anger_Guitar


 - Somewhat happy - only Happy_Piano
 - Quite happy - Happy_Piano and Happy_Guitar
 - Very happy - all the happy tracks.
